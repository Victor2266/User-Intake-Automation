# User-Intake-Automation
This is a Google App Script Web App designed to automate the workflow of adding new employees to a google workspace, creating company emails for each of them, and sending them email verifications. 

Their data is added to a Google Sheet after they fill out a Google Form and this Web App reads all the data from that sheet.
